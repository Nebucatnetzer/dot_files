# dot files

This repository contains backups of my various dot files and custom scripts.
I use stow to link the config files to their intended place.

In addition I use various scripts to restore specific configurations.

E.g. run restore_desktop.sh will install all required packages and link
the required config files for my prefered desktop setup.
